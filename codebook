Codebook.MD of Smartphones Tracking Human Activity 

This code book describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

Data Background

•	Wearable technologies are increasingly being used as a tool to track human activity for tracking healthcare decisions and improving decisions. The dataset includes 30 volunteers from the age of 19-49, using the accelerometer data from their Samsung Galaxy S smartphones. The raw data set can be located in the UCI Machine Learning Repository, under the title “Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set”.  The URL is below. 
o	http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones


The data set uses the following files from UCI Machine Learning Repository URL

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature file.

- 'features.txt': List of all variables listed and needed for column headers.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

Study Design: 

Data Collection- Raw data
•	Turn link /URL into a variable
•	download file url using link
•	rundata<- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip"
•	Click on link, download to download file, move to Course 3 Project file.

Data Transformations- order of operations used
1.	Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set (requirement 1)
2.	Label activities (requirement 3)
3.	Label data set with descriptive variable names. (requirement 4)
4.	Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement (requirement 2)
5.	From the names created in requirement 4, create an independent tidy data set with the average for each activity and each subject. (requirement 5)


Variables, data sets, and transformations created the in run_analysis.R file to merge the Test and Training data sets together and run basic analysis:
•	rundata: a link / URL to the wearable data set provided by UCI Machine Learning Repository
•	X_test: uses read.table() to import the raw test data from X_test.txt 
•	X_train: uses read.table() to import the raw training data from X_train.txt
•	(V1:V561) in X_test and X_ train correspond to the column headers and values found in the features.txt file. 
•	subject_test: uses read.table() to import the test subjects data from subject_test.txt
•	subject_train: uses read.table() to import the training subjects data from subject_train.txt
•	V1 from subject_test and subject_train is a column of subjects
•	features:
•	test_df: turns X_test into a data frame using dplyr function tbl_df
•	train_df: turns X_train into a data frame using dplyr function tbl_df
•	Test_ID: turns subject_test into a data frame using dplyr function tbl_df
•	Train_ID: turns subject_train into a data frame using dplyr function tbl_df
•	Test_ID_Renamed: column V1 is renamed ID in the data set Test_ID 
•	Train_ID_Renamed: column V1 is renamed ID in the data set Train_ID
•	test_df_id: test_df and Test_ID_Renamed are joined using bind_cols()
•	train_df_id: train_df and Train_ID_Renamed are joined using bind_cols()
•	merged_data: Merges the two main data sets, train_df_id and test_df_id on the basis of ‘ID’
•	merged_in_order_of_id: Rearranges the data in order of subject number 
•	merged_data_renamed: this function renames the V1:V561 based of features.txt file
•	Averages_merged: this takes the averages of all columns in merged_data_renamed
•	Standard_deviations_merged: takes standard deviation of all columns merged_data_renamed
•	Individuals: groups data by individuals ID 
•	Individuals_averages: takes average of variables on an individual basis
•	Individuals_averages_renamed: renames Variables in data set Individuals_averages
